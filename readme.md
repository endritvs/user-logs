## Installation

1. **Get the Package**

    Install via Composer:
    ```bash
    composer require endritvs/user-logs:^dev-main
    ```

2. **Configure Middleware**

    Register the middleware in your application. First, add it to the `$routeMiddleware` property of your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file:
    ```php
    protected $routeMiddleware = [
        // ... other middleware ...
        'track.user.log' => \Endritvs\UserLogs\Middleware\TrackUserLogMiddleware::class,
    ];
    ```

    Now, you can use the `track.user.log` middleware in your routes file to apply it to individual routes or groups of routes:
    ```php
    Route::middleware('track.user.log')->group(function () {
        // ... your routes ...
    });
    ```

3. **Configure Logging Channel**

    Register the custom logging channel in `config/logging.php`:
    ```php
    'user_logs' => [
        'driver' => 'custom',
        'via' => Endritvs\UserLogs\TrackUserLog::class,
    ]
    ```

4. **Usage**

    Use Laravel's native logging system to log user activities:
    ```php
    Log::channel('user_logs')->info('User performed a specific action.');
    ```

    By default, logs are found in `storage/logs/user_logs`. They're sorted by user ID and the respective controller action.
